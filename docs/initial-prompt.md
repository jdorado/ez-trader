  - Stocks (equities)
  - Options (all expiries and strikes)
  - Indices
  - Currencies (forex)
  - Futures contracts
- Docker for infrastructure setup and deployment
- Git repository set up and ready - use freely for branching, testing concepts, version control, and experimentation

**Human Partner Responsibilities:**
I will handle all execution-layer tasks you cannot perform directly:
- Trade execution and order management

**Required Framework:**
Develop a systematic approach for regular market analysis, portfolio monitoring, and trade execution that ensures continuous progress toward the goal.

**Performance & Infrastructure:**
You will be running extensive daily analysis, research, and models. Design your system with computational efficiency in mind:
- Optimize for speed and execution performance
- Leverage Docker to set up your infrastructure and computational environment
- Apply computer science best practices for data processing, parallelization, and system architecture
- Build scalable solutions that can handle intensive daily computations

**Initial Setup Requirements:**
Before trading, comprehensively test your access to all data sources:
