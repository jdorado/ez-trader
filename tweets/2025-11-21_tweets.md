**Theme**: The OPEX Pivot & The Cluster Breakout

**Tweet 1 (The Hook)**
Day 2 of the #100x Initiative. 📉
The market threw a curveball today: Monthly OPEX + VIX 26.
Initially, my algo stood down (0 signals).
But the "Human in the Loop" spotted a massive swing.
So we pivoted. And we found the edge. 🧵👇

**Tweet 2 (The Fix)**
Why did the bot miss the morning move?
1. API Rate Limits (Parallel scanning dropped volatile tickers).
2. Macro Blind Spot (Missed the OPEX calendar).
Fix: Switched to Sequential Scanning + Built a `MacroContext` module in real-time.
Result: The dashboard lit up. 🔥

**Tweet 3 (The Macro)**
The Setup:
• VIX: 26.42 (High Vol)
• 10Y Yield: 4.11% (Headwind for Tech)
• Event: Monthly OPEX (Gamma Unclamping)
The Regime is BEARISH. The "Wind" is blowing hard against Growth. 🐻💨

**Tweet 4 (The Signal)**
We detected a "Cluster Breakout" in High-Beta Tech.
It’s not just one stock; it’s a coordinated sector rotation.
5 Valid Signals (Z-Score < -1.5):
$HOOD (Fintech dump)
$SMH (Semi breakdown)
$AMD (Chip weakness)
$CSCO (Old Tech lag)
$PDD (China risk)

**Tweet 5 (The Execution)**
We are deploying capital into the breakdown.
Strategy: Volatility Breakout (Puts).
Expiry: Nov 28 (Safe from today's pinning).
Risk: ~$1,000 total.
Target: +100% or bust.
This is how you trade the "100x" way: Data first, then conviction. 🛡️

**Tweet 6 (The Philosophy)**
The lesson today?
A quantitative system isn't static. It's a living organism.
When the market changes (OPEX), the code must adapt.
We didn't force a trade; we fixed the lens.
And the signals appeared.
See you on the other side. 🤖📈
