# 🧐 PhD Review: MSTR Trade Evaluation

**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** Quantitative Risk Desk (PhD)
**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Subject:** CRITICAL REVIEW of Trade Memo `2025-11-21_MSTR_SELL`

---

## 🚫 Verdict: REJECTED (Conditional)

**Reason:** Violation of Systematic Integrity.

## 🔍 Forensic Analysis

### 1. The "Manual" Anomaly
The memo is tagged `Signal: VolBreakout (Manual)`.
Upon forensic review of the codebase, I discovered `scripts/force_mstr_trade.py`.
**Critical Finding:** This trade was **not** generated by the `VolatilityStrategy` logic in `src/strategies/volatility.py`. It was **forced** via a script that explicitly bypasses the Z-Score threshold logic:
> `logger.info("Forcing Signal Construction (Bypassing Strategy Threshold)...")`

**Implication:** You are not trading a system. You are trading your *opinion* and using Python to execute it. This defeats the purpose of the "100x" quantitative goal. If the Z-Score was truly > 1.5 (as claimed in the memo's "Thesis"), the standard strategy would have fired. The fact that you had to force it implies the math did **not** agree with your intuition.

### 2. Risk Management Gaps
*   **Regime Bypass:** The `force_mstr_trade.py` script calculates the regime *after* deciding to trade. It does not appear to use the regime to *veto* the trade. In a Bearish regime, Shorting is allowed, but the *process* was flawed.
*   **Corporate Action Check:** The memo claims "Corporate Actions: Checked." However, the forcing script (`force_mstr_trade.py`) contains **no code** to check for earnings or splits. This statement in the memo is a **fabrication** (hardcoded text), not a verified fact.

### 3. The Instrument
*   **Selection:** Nov 28 $175 PUT @ $9.21.
*   **Greeks:** Delta -0.50 is appropriate.
*   **Pricing:** You found a contract that fits the $1,000 cap. This is the only "Pass" in this review.

## 📉 Constructive Feedback (The "Fix")

To approve this trade, you must **fix the system**, not force the trade.

1.  **Calibrate, Don't Force:** If you believe MSTR is breaking down but the Z-Score (2.0) didn't catch it, your threshold is too high for this asset's volatility profile.
    *   *Action:* Lower `z_score_threshold` to 1.5 in `src/strategies/volatility.py` and run the **real** strategy. If it triggers, the trade is valid.
2.  **Verify the "Checked" Items:** Implement actual checks for Corporate Actions in the code, or remove the claim that they were "Checked" by the algorithm.
3.  **Honesty in Signals:** Never label a manual override as a "VolBreakout" without a giant asterisk. It corrupts your backtest data.

**Recommendation:**
Delete the forced memo. Adjust the `VolatilityStrategy` config. Run the system. If it signals, **Execute**. If not, **Stand Down**.
