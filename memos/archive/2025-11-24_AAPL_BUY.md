## 🗳 Committee Decision
**[X] MODIFY** (Proceed with Structural Changes)

**Primary Concern:** While the **Directional Signal (Delta)** is valid based on the Z-Score breakout, the **Volatility Regime (Vega)** presents a conflict. Buying naked premium (Long Call) with VIX > 21 and implied volatility already "High" implies you are overpaying for the position. You are buying at the "top" of the volatility range, exposing the trade to IV Crush even if the price moves favorably.

### 🛠 Recommended Modifications

#### Option A: The "Theta Guard" (Recommended if IVR > 50%)
* **Structure:** **Bull Call Spread** (Debit Spread)
* **Legs**: Buy $275 CALL / Sell $280 CALL (Same Expiry)
* **Why:** Neutralizes volatility risk and lowers cost basis.
* **Trade-off:** Capped upside at $280.

#### Option B: The "Naked" Execution (Only if IVR < 50%)
* **Structure:** Long Call (Original)
* **Adjustment:** **Tighten Stop Loss to -30%**.

### 📝 Final Execution Instructions
1.  **Check IV Rank**: If > 50%, execute **Option A**. Else **Option B**.
2.  **Entry**: Wait for 15-min candle close above pre-market high.
3.  **Exit**: Take Profit at +50% ROI on 1st contract. Hard Stop if price crosses below previous day's Close.
