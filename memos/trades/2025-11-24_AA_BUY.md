## 🗳 Committee Decision
**[X] MODIFY** (Proceed with Structural Changes)

**Primary Concern:** The **Directional Signal (Delta)** is validated by a confirmed sector-wide breakout (Aluminum futures up ~3%). However, the **Structure** (4 DTE OTM Call) is suboptimal for the current **Volatile Market Regime (VIX > 21)**. Chasing an extended move with short-dated OTM calls risks Theta burn and IV contraction.

### 🛠 Recommended Modifications

#### Option A: The "Financed Breakout" (Recommended)
* **Structure:** **Bull Call Spread** (Debit Spread)
* **Legs**: Buy $38.5 CALL / Sell $40.0 CALL (Same Expiry)
* **Why:** Lowers cost basis, protects against Theta decay, and lowers breakeven to ~$38.95.
* **Trade-off:** Capped upside at $40.00.

#### Option B: The "Aggressive" Execution (Momentum Only)
* **Structure:** Naked Call ($38.50)
* **Adjustment:** **Manual Trailing Stop**. Cut immediately if stock price drops below **$37.00**.

### 📝 Final Execution Instructions
1.  **Limit Order**: Use Limit Order at Mid-Price if Bid/Ask spread > $0.05.
2.  **Timing**: Wait for a pullback to **VWAP** on the 15-min chart.
3.  **Exit**: Take Profit (50%) at Option Price $1.10. Hold runner for $40.00 test.
