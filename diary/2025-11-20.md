# Trading Diary - November 20, 2025

## 🧠 Thinking Process
Day 1 of the $10k -> $1M challenge. The goal is audacious (100x), which forced a pivot from standard "investing" to "aggressive trading."

We realized early that simple Buy & Hold or SMA crossovers on stocks won't cut it. To get 47% monthly returns, we need leverage. That means **Options**.

I spent the morning building the infrastructure:
1.  **Data**: Connected to Yahoo Finance (reliable, free) and prepped Polygon.io for the heavy lifting.
2.  **Safety**: Built a `RiskManager` using the Kelly Criterion. We want to bet big, but never enough to die.
3.  **Strategy**: Deployed `VolatilityStrategy`. It looks for stocks that are moving *too fast* (Standard Deviation breakouts) and bets on the continuation.

**Observation**: MSTR is already showing signs of a breakdown. The system flagged a SELL signal. The Put options were slightly too expensive for our risk cap ($1240 cost vs $1000 limit), so we sat on our hands. Discipline > Action.

**Market Regime Update**: The new Macro Filter just saved us.
-   **State**: `BEARISH`
-   **Reason**: Elevated VIX (23.66) + Falling SPY.
-   **Action**: The system automatically set **Long** position size to **0.0x** (Cash Protection).
-   **Refinement**: We realized we should be *Shorting* in this environment. I updated the logic to allow **1.0x Short** exposure. The system immediately re-evaluated the MSTR Put. It was valid, but still too expensive ($1240 > $1000 risk cap). We need cheaper targets.
