# 📔 Trading Diary: 2025-11-24

## 🌍 Macro & Context
*   **Theme**: Volatility Breakout Day - Selective Execution
*   **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (VIX: 21.25)
*   **Key Drivers**: VIX > 20, Sector rotation (Materials, Crypto rebound)

## 🤖 System Signals
The Aggressive Scan generated 16 initial signals. After Investment Committee review and risk filtering, we executed **3 high-conviction trades** (all structured as spreads to mitigate Vega risk in elevated VIX environment).

| Ticker | Action | Structure | Entry | Size | Cost | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AAPL** | BUY | Spread 275/280 | $1.97 | 2 | $394 | ✅ Filled |
| **AA** | BUY | Spread 38.5/40 | $0.55 | 7 | $385 | ✅ Filled |
| **COIN** | BUY | Spread 250/257.5 | $3.60 | 1 | $360 | ✅ Filled |

**Total Allocated**: $1,139.00

## 📝 Execution Notes
*   **AAPL**: Modified from naked call to spread per Committee recommendation. IV/HV ratio (1.02) was fair, but VIX > 21 warranted risk mitigation.
*   **AA**: Sector-wide Materials breakout (Aluminum futures +3%). Spread structure protects against Theta decay on 4 DTE position.
*   **COIN**: Crypto proxy play. BTC check passed (flat/green). Spread entry at $3.60 vs $5.00 naked call saved $140 in premium.

### Thread 1 – Market Analysis
1. "Monday market open. VIX at 21.25 signals MEDIUM risk regime. Our engine scanned 53 tickers, filtered to 16 signals, and the Investment Committee approved 3 high-conviction plays. Discipline > Volume. #OptionsTrading #RiskManagement"

2. "All 3 positions structured as SPREADS (not naked calls) to mitigate Vega risk in this elevated VIX environment. When volatility is high, you don't buy premium—you SELL it. Bull call spreads let us capture directional moves while capping downside. 🛡️"

### Thread 2 – Trade Highlights
1. "$AAPL 275/280 Call Spread @ $1.97 | Volatility breakout with fair IV/HV (1.02). Spread structure protects against IV crush if market consolidates. Max risk: $394. Max gain: $606 at $280+. Breakeven: $276.97. 📈"

2. "$AA 38.5/40 Call Spread @ $0.55 | Riding the Aluminum futures surge (+3% today). Materials sector breakout confirmed. 4 DTE means Theta is the enemy—spread neutralizes decay. 7 contracts, $385 risk. Exit plan: 50% at $1.10. 🔥"

3. "$COIN 250/257.5 Call Spread @ $3.60 | Crypto proxy play. BTC stabilized (passed our 'red check'). Spread saved us $140 vs naked call ($5.00). Currently +1.94%. Stop: $248. Target: $260. 🚀"

### Thread 3 – Process & Discipline
1. "The Investment Committee rejected 13 signals today. Why? Expensive IV (miners like MARA, BITF had IV/HV > 3x), extended moves (chasing), or poor risk/reward. Our edge isn't finding signals—it's filtering them. 🧠"

2. "Portfolio allocation: $1,139 across 3 positions. All expire Friday (4 DTE). This is a 'sprint, not a marathon' week. We're hunting quick 30-50% gains on spreads, not holding for max profit. Theta decay accelerates exponentially in the final days. ⏱️"

3. "End-of-day plan: Monitor for Committee exit triggers. AAPL: regime change. AA: stock below $37. COIN: stock below $248. If conditions fail, we cut. No 'hope trading.' The algorithm found the edge—our job is to protect it. 💎🙌"
