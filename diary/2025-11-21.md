# 📔 Trading Diary: The "100x" Initiative

## Day 2: November 21, 2025
**Theme**: "The OPEX Pivot"

### 1. Morning Briefing 🌅
*   **Initial State**: The system initially reported **0 Signals**.
*   **The Anomaly**: The user noted a "huge swing" in the market that the bot missed.
*   **Root Cause**:
    1.  **API Rate Limiting**: Parallel scanning caused `yfinance` to drop data for volatile tickers.
    2.  **Macro Blind Spot**: The system failed to realize today was **Monthly OPEX** (Nov 21).

### 2. The Pivot 🔄
*   **Fix 1 (Technical)**: Switched to **Sequential Scanning** (`max_workers=1`) to ensure data integrity.
*   **Fix 2 (Macro)**: Implemented `MacroContext` to flag OPEX, VIX (26.42), and Rates (4.11%).
*   **Result**: The system immediately lit up with **5 Valid Signals**.

### 3. The Strategy: "Cluster Breakout" 📉
We are seeing a coordinated breakdown in High-Beta Tech and Semis. This is not an isolated stock moving; it is a **Sector Rotation** driven by Macro headwinds (Rates + Dollar).
*   **Signal**: Volatility Breakout (Z-Score < -1.5).
*   **Regime**: BEARISH (Risk Off).
*   **Expiry**: Nov 28 (Safe from today's OPEX pinning).
